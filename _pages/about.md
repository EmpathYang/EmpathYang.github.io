Hello there! I'm Ke Yang (杨可), currently embarking on my first year of pursuing a Ph.D. at UIUC under the guidance of Professor [Chengxiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/). I hold a bachelor's degree in Automation from Tsinghua University, where I had the privilege of contributing as a research assistant within Professor [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/)'s research group. During the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to intern with Professor [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html)'s esteemed group at UIUC.

My academic journey revolves around the captivating realm of natural language processing, with a special fervor for the domains of **intelligent agents**, **language models**, **graph neural networks**, and **multimodality foundation models**. During the winter break of 2022, I orchestrated a collaboration with a team of skilled software engineers. Our collective efforts culminated in the creation of [*Zempath*](#jump), an innovative online social platform that introduces chatbots endowed with distinctive personalities. My attention is also finely attuned to **NLP for societal benefit** and **efficient learning methodologies**.

<h3>If LLM Is the Wizard, Then Code Is the Wand: A Survey on How Code Empowers Large Language Models to Serve as Intelligent Agents</h3>
<span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: smaller;"><b>Ke Yang</b>\*, Jiateng Liu\*, John Wu, Chaoqi Yang, Yi R. Fung, Sha Li, Zixuan Huang, Xu Cao, Xingyao Wang, Yiquan Wang, Heng Ji, Chengxiang Zhai  (* indicates equal contributions)</span>

<br>
<em style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: smaller;">The Wizard survey explores the synergy between code and large language models (LLMs), highlighting how code empowers LLMs and benefits LLM when they serve as intelligent agents. We emphasized code’s readability, symbolic abstraction, and graph structure, presenting it as a valuable component in LLMs’ training corpus.</em>

Miscellaneous
------
Although I was born and raised in Shanghai, China, my true origins trace back to a serene and lesser-known village in Anhui. It's there that my family is the proud custodian of a golden paddy field and a haven for wild geese!

I am an amateur novelist, [painter](/images/hey_you.jpg), and photographer. I take photos of [cats](/images/cat.jpg), [my sister](/images/my_cool_sister.jpg), [grandparents](/images/my_grandparents.jpg), [friends](/images/on_my_21th_birthday.png), [campus](/images/campus.png), etc., in my spare time.
