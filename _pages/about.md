Hello there! I'm Ke Yang, currently embarking on my first year of pursuing a Ph.D. at UIUC under the guidance of Professor [Chengxiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/). I hold a bachelor's degree in Automation from Tsinghua University, where I had the privilege of contributing as a research assistant within Professor [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/)'s research group. During the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to intern with Professor [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html)'s esteemed group at UIUC.

My academic journey revolves around the captivating realm of natural language processing, with a special fervor for the domains of **language generation** and **conversational AI**. During the winter break of 2022, I orchestrated a collaboration with a team of skilled software engineers. Our collective efforts culminated in the creation of [*Zempath*](#jump), an innovative online social platform that introduces chatbots endowed with distinctive personalities. My attention is also finely attuned to **NLP for societal benefit** and **efficient learning methodologies**.

Miscellaneous
------
Although I was born and raised in Shanghai, China, my true origins trace back to a serene and lesser-known village in Anhui. It's there that my family is the proud custodian of a golden paddy field and a haven for wild geese!

I am an amateur novelist, [painter](/images/hey_you.jpg), and photographer. I take photos of [cats](/images/cat.jpg), [my sister](/images/my_cool_sister.jpg), [grandparents](/images/my_grandparents.jpg), [friends](/images/on_my_21th_birthday.png), [campus](/images/campus.png), etc., in my spare time.
