Hi! My name is Ke Yang. I am currently a senior student at Tsinghua University majoring in Automation, where I am fortunate to have been advised by Prof. [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/), Prof. [Yang Yu](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/zh/yuy/), and Prof. [Hairong Lv](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WU1tm2EAAAAJ). I also interned at UIUC [BLENDER Lab](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/) in 2022, advised by Prof. [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html).

My research interests lie in **natural language processing**, and I am particularly excited about **language generation and conversational AI**. Over the 2022 winter break, I assembled a team of software engineers, and we together created [*Zempath*](#jump), an online social platform featuring chatbots with distinct personalities. I also pay close attention to **NLP for social good** and **efficient learning**.

Research Experiences
------
**ADEPT: A DEbiasing PrompT Framework**	Jun. 2022 â€“ Aug. 2022  
*Research Assistant, Advisor: Heng Ji, Professor, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.*
* Exploited prompt tuning in the debiasing space.
* Introduced a novel debiasing criterion, which often enabled the debiased model to perform better than the original one in downstream tasks.
* Conducted extensive experiments and showed that the new debiasing algorithm ADEPT was more effective at mitigating biases on a word embedding manifold than other methods which operated on a linear bias subspace.
* Proposed methods for improving prototypes for contextualized word embeddings that were generated via aggregation.

**Exploring the Capabilities of Prompts in Transfer Learning**	Apr. 2022 - Present  
*Research Assistant, Advisor: Jie Tang, Professor, Tsinghua University.*
* Tracked variables during the multitask prompt tuning process, and discovered that prompt tuning was incapable of handling tasks with lengthy inputs, special labels, and unfixed label numbers.
* Added additional prompt prefixes to the decoder of the T5-large, and performed parametrization on the prompt parameters, resulting in an order-of-magnitude loss improvement with the new loss comparable to the loss in the finetuning setting.
* Proposed distributed prompt tokens and prompt residual connections to improve prompt tuning's capacity for optimization on T5.

**Social Discrimination or Statistical Error: A Statistical Foundation of Bias, Disparity, and Fairness of Pre-trained Language Models**	Sept. 2021 - Present  
*Research Assistant, Advisor: Yang Yu, Assistant Professor, Tsinghua University.*
* Took Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) as estimators and proposed a non-parametric method to analyze discrimination in these PLMs.
* Introduced two schemes to form the sample for estimation concerning different causes of discrimination (e.g., gender, race, religion), and provided the corresponding evaluation methods.
* Analyzed the basis and the mechanism of the PLMs' displaying biases by conducting hypothesis testing.
* Took GPT2, BERT, RoBERTa, etc., as the illustrating example, and performed the algorithmic discrimination risk assessment and test.

**A Survey on Language Models for Knowledge**	May 2021  
*Research Assistant, Advisor: Jie Tang, Professor, Tsinghua University.*
* Collaborated with other students on gathering papers and teasing out the development of prompts, which served as additional inputs for the PLMs to improve their performance.
* Contributed to a survey on how knowledge and technology had developed relating to prompts.

In *Zempath*'s promotional video, we introduce our motivations and core concepts, and display how users can chat, post anonymously or with their real name, converse with chatbots, and make new friends here. Take a look at a clip from the amazing video:

Miscellaneous
------
While I was born and brought up in Shanghai, China, I am actually from an obscure and gentle village in Anhui. We have golden paddy field and wild geese here!  
I am an amateur novalist and photographer. I take photos of my sister, parents, grandparents and friends in my spare time.
