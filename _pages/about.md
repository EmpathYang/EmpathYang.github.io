Hi! My name is Ke Yang. I am currently a senior student at Tsinghua University majoring in Automation, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/), Prof. [Yang Yu](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/zh/yuy/), and Prof. [Hairong Lv](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WU1tm2EAAAAJ).

My research interests lie in natural language processing, and I am particularly excited about **language generation and conversational AI**. Over the 2022 winter break, I assembled a team of software engineers, and we together created [*Zempath*](#jump), an online social platform featuring chatbots with distinct personalities. I also pay close attention to **NLP for social good** and **efficient learning**.

Oops! We are not maintaining the website currently. 

But in *Zempath*'s promotional video, we've introduced our motivations and core concepts, and have displayed how users can chat, post anonymously or with their real name, converse with chatbots, and make new friends here. Take a look at a clip from the amazing video:
